#Club RockETS base station

This project is a python project developped for a student club called RockETS at ETS (École de Technologie Supérieure).
RockETS participate anually to the IREC (Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition). 
The goal of the competition is to develop, build and launch a sounding rocket, reach a precise altitude,
perform a scientific experience during the flight and recover the rocket in good shape. To do so, tracking the 
rocket is essential. This project is the base station that will be used to track the rocket during the flight, 
send command to the rocket, get telemetry data, review the logs, etc., using different serial devices such as 
RFD900 and xbee.
